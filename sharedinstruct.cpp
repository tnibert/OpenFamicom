 * This file defines functions that have common code between opcodes
 * For example, lda has several opcodes for different addressing modes
 * but outside of the addressing modes, they basically do the same thing.
 * There is also instructions like lda, ldx, ldy - same concept, different registers
 *
 * Keep our code compact and manageable
 *
 * This will probably mostly be for handling flags
 * These functions will not increase the program counter as the instruction size may vary
